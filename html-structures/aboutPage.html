            <p>
                Russell Sammut-Bonnici also known as "Russell Esby" had the idea for making the site on musical instruments.
                He worked on the About Us page as well as some styling. Working on the styling was hard because it conflicted
                a lot with his colleague Dr.Jenkins, the pushes did not want to co-operate and temporarily broke the website which
                made him a little sad. When he is not at University, focusing aggressively, he can be found hosting a TV Show called
                "Instrument's Got Talent". In this show instruments are tested for talent and with the right sound they are hired with
                much respect and money into the humble inventory of SyneWave Music Store. Ukuleles are hired automatically.

            <p>
                Andre Jenkins worked on the front end of this website. He managed to animate and perfect the header toolbar
                at the top to the point of ecstatic satisfaction. When he is not at University, studying aggressively, he is
                at home binge watching YouTube videos or editing content to put on his own channel. He always enjoyed music but
                never really understood the specifics so by making this site he aimed to test his programming skills and appear
                more like a musician, even though he can't identify the difference between a pentatonic minor or a pentatonic major.
                He enjoys peaceful strolls in the park, as well as Hawaiin Pizza with extra cheese. In Mexico he is also known
                as an ancient prophet.

            <h2 class="name">Sean Powell</h2>
            <img class="selfpic" src="../images/SeanP.png" alt="Portrait of Sean" />

            <p>
                Sean Powell worked on the back end of this website. With supreme dedication to the martial arts of PHP he
                made the site dynamic. Enjoying sarcastic humour, on Sunday evenings he can be found in Riviera Bay enjoying
                a classic cocktail whilst admiring the many different shades of the shimmering horizon. Favourite foods of his include
                ham sandwiches, hot dogs and ice cream bacon cake. He is aware that ice cream bacon cake does not exist, merely
                just as a concept, but is determined to make it possible. When he was 5 years old he got his finger stuck into a CD
                tray as it was closing, and got bitten by a computer. From then on he has been leading a dual life as both Sean Powell by day
                and Computer Man by night.
