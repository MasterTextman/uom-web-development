                is the possessor of the Triforce of Power, imbued with the essence of the Goddess Din. This divine relic
                makes Ganon unimaginably strong and grants him boundless mystical power, making him a grave threat to the
                land of Hyrule and the world. Additionally, Ganon is the source of darkness. As stated in prophecy, the only
                one capable of defeating Ganon is the Hero who is chosen by the Goddesses. As the manifestation of the Demon
                King Demise's hatred for the Goddess and her Chosen Hero (or, according to the Hyrule Historia, the
                reincarnation of Demise himself) Ganon is destined to eternally reincarnate to pursue world domination.
